                <p>
                    Homeschooled by my mom and equipped by my dad with
                    a vast knowledge of engines and electricity, I
                    have been able to explore and enjoy numerous
                    hobbies that keep me busy in between work and
                    serving at church. I enjoy using well-designed
                    software and have a passion for creating great
                    UI/UX.
