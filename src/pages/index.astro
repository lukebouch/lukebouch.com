        <p>
            Homeschooled by my mom and equipped by my dad with a vast
            knowledge of engines and electricity, I have been able to
            explore and enjoy numerous hobbies that keep me busy in
            between work and serving at church. I enjoy using well-
            designed software and have a passion for creating great
            UI/UX.
