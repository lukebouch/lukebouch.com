I have been working on my 2007 Chevy Colorado for a while now. I just finished up restoring my bumper. I had to sand it down, fill the dents with Bondo, and then primer, paint, and final apply a 2k clear coat.

For the base coat, I used spray paint that was custom mixed for the original factory color. I purchased the base coat, clear coat, and a touch up bottle from [automotive touch up](automotivetouchup.com) and highly recommend them.

Iâ€™m rather pleased with how it turned out and just have to finish it up by polishing and waxing it.
