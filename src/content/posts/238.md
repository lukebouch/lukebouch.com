Today I worked on cleaning and organizing my desk. I still have some work to do but it is already much more functional.

I mounted a small shelf underneath my desk where I can place my MacBook Pro while it is plugged into my Caldigit TS3 Plus.

I also ran a Cat 6 wire to an WiFi access point which also acts as a ethernet switch. Hopefully this will improve speeds now that I have a wired connection and increase WiFi coverage on this side of the house. Ohâ€¦ and I also have my Synology DS418 with 2x 4TB Seagate IronWolf drives in it. It is also wired directly into the access point.
