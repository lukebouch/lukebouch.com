I’m back working on a project (TPP) I was told to take a break on a few months ago. It’s a web app built with Laravel, AlpineJS, Livewire, and Tailwindcss. It is actually the first real web app I ever built.

Prior to TPP, I had only just begun learning PHP and trying to build a web app (Open Outreach) in vanilla PHP. I did not even know frameworks were a thing. I just had a php file for every page and would manually query the database with SQL. To say the least, Open Outreach did not get very far.

I made some mistakes on TPP but I’m a much better developer now and it’s fun ripping out old components and rebuilding things. I have already improved things drastically in just a few hours.

Currently working on redesigning the whole UI. I will keep posting update periodically.
