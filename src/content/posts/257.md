Today I was listening to the podcast, [North Meets South](https://share.transistor.fm/s/96e54402), and Jake and Michael were discussing the script Jake created to randomly generate a fake wordle emoji grid. The goal was to be able to, everyday, share a random result with your friends to get in on the social aspect of wordle without actually playing it. 

Jake mentioned that he was going to rewrite it in JavaScript and put it online, but he decided it was not worth the time. Now Iâ€™m considering taking on the challenge of bringing it to the web myself. 

Is it worth getting a domain name for it or should I just use a subdomain of [lukebouch.com](https://lukebouch.com)?
