Iâ€™m continuing work on Sublime Blogs. Yesterday I spent a while working on the [marketing site](https://sublimeblogs.com) and getting feedback from other developers. I also setup a form where you can subscribe to get an email when I launch the product; which should hopefully be in the next two months or so. 

I have migrated my site over from [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) to a static site built with [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.com), hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com), with deploys being trigger and blog posts being pulled in from [Sublime Blogs](https://sublimeblogs.com).
