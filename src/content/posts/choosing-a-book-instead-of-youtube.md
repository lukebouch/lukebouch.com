After I finished work and spent a few hours working on a few projects today, I had a few options for how I could spend the last little bit of time of my day. I decided to read a book instead of watching YouTube videos and Iâ€™m so glad I made that choice. The time spent was so much better used reading than watching a YouTube video for a number of reasons. It was relaxing, taught me a lot more than I would have gotten from a video, made me feel like I had spent the time wisely, and did not suck me in like endless videos do.

I hope to make this a pattern.
