Imposter syndrome is definitely something I struggle with. I get my workflows and software all setup and then I see someone else using a different setup and I rethink everything. This, coupled with the fact that I like new shiny software, causes me to constantly reconsider my software suite. 

For right now, I’m using [Bear](https://bear.app) for all of my note taking and for writing blog posts. It’s working well so far. I may switch to [Nota](https://nota.md) when my current yearly [Bear](https://bear.app) subscription runs up. We will see.
