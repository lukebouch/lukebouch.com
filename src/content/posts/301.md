I’m starting to get really excited about the [PlayDate by Panic](https://play.date) I ordered. They are saying I will get it sometime next year but I’m hoping they will successfully ramp up production and get it sooner.

I ordered it not too long after hearing about it but, evidently, I should have ordered it sooner. In the meantime, I can begin learning the Lua programming language so I can write games for it.

Now to think up some game ideas.
