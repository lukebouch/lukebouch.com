I totally lost the ball on blogging recently. I have been making some changes to my site recently and it is not as easy to post now and therefor I post less. I'm hoping to have a little more time soon to get a few kinks worked out.

I'm considering changing a few things up in regard to the way I blog and hopefully start having posting some more coherent thoughts.
