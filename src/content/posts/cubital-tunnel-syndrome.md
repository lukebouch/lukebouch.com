Shortly after starting my first full-time job as a web developer, I started experiencing pretty significant pain in my hands. At the time of this writing, it‚Äôs been about 10 months and I can‚Äôt remember exactly how it started. I think it started in my fingers but I do know a few months into it I had severe pain in both of my wrists.

The pain was hard to describe. It was very sharp and deep, but at the same time I could not pin point where the pain was coming from. It felt as if my wrists were forced to be bent in a way they were not supposed to. They did not looks this way but they sure did feel like it.

At a little over three months into my employment at Wilber, I was flown out to Wilber‚Äôs offices in Illinois to spend a week getting to know my coworkers in person. By the time I got home, the pain had gotten so bad that my mom made me an appointment to go see a hand specialist.

The doctor suspected a nerve issues and he suggested I get an EMG test done to see the severity of it. Because of some communication issues, it took me about three months to get an appointment to have the test done.

In the mean time, I continued to research my symptoms and talk to anyone I could that might have an idea for something that would help.

I friend at church suggested a see go a physical therapist and like the doctor, she suspected a nerve problem. The ulnar in particular. She gave me lots of great suggestions and nerve glides to do. These seemed to have great results initially but after about two or three weeks, the pain came right back.

As I waited to have the EMG test done, the pain kept getting worse. It also spread from being mostly localized to my wrists and hands to now running up my arms almost to my shoulders. 

It was around this time (or maybe even a little earlier) that I began trying to get my keyboard lower. This brought my arms to more do a 90 degree angle or maybe even a little less. 

I started noticing the pain lessening. There were even a few weeks where the pain was negligible and practically gone. This gave me a lot of hope and I almost cancelled the EMG test but my mom was insistent I not. I‚Äôm so glad I listened to her. Thanks, mom!

I had the test done which was a very uncomfortable and painful experience. I was poked and prodded with needles and shocked with electric dozens of upon dozens of times.

It took a week or two until I could get an appointment to go over the results with the doctor. He said everything looked normal but still suspected the pain was caused by a nerve problem. More specifically, Cubital Tunnel Syndrome.

He said that because I was so young (19 at the time), my nerves can tolerate a lot before their function would become impaired. Unfortunately, not without severe pain from it being compromised.

Because my nerves were still functioning fine, the EMG test did not reveal anything out of the ordinary.

Next, the doctor recommended I get night time braces to keep my arms at about a 30 degree angle to remove any pressure on the ulnar nerves cashed by my arms being bent. The closer they are to 30 degrees, the less pressure and tension the nerve is under.

I wore the braces for over a month with negligible results. In fact, sometimes it even felt worse after wearing them. I even broke on in my sleep. Oops üòÅ. The doctor said since they didn‚Äôt seem to be helping, not to bother with wearing them. Or at least not wear the **one** I have left.

At this point, I was running out of non-surgical options and so after thinking about it got a week or two, I called and scheduled the surgery.
