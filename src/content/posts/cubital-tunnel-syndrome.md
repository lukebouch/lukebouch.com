Shortly after starting my first full-time job as a web developer, I started experiencing pretty significant pain in my hands. At the time of this writing, it’s been about 10 months and I can’t remember exactly how it started. I think it started in my fingers but I do know a few months into it I had severe pain in both of my wrists.

The pain was hard to describe. It was very sharp and deep, but at the same time I could not pin point where the pain was coming from. It felt as if my wrists were forced to be bent in a way they were not supposed to. They did not looks this way but they sure did feel like it.

At a little over three months into my employment at Wilber, I was flown out to Wilber’s offices in Illinois to spend a week getting to know my coworkers in person. By the time I got home, the pain had gotten so bad that my mom made me an appointment to go see a hand specialist.

The doctor suspected a nerve issues and he suggested I get an EMG test done to see the severity of it. Because of some communication issues, it took me about three months to get an appointment to have the test done.

In the mean time, I continued to research my symptoms and talk to anyone I could that might have an idea for something that would help.

I friend at church suggested a see go a physical therapist and like the doctor, she suspected a nerve problem. The ulnar in particular. She gave me lots of great suggestions and nerve glides to do. These seemed to have great results initially but after about two or three weeks, the pain came right back.

As I waited to have the EMG test done, the pain kept getting worse. It also spread from being mostly localized to my wrists and hands to now running up my arms almost to my shoulders.
