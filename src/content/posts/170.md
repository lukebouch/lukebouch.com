I got tired of stuggling learning VueJS and Nuxt, so I decided to build out my new blog in [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.com). It is almost done and I will be moving away from [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) in favor of my new headless cms I’m working on ([Sublime blogs](https://sublimeblogs.com)).

I have nothing against [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) but I’m a control freek and I want complete control over the frontend using my static site generator of choice. I’m also trying to cut down on costs.
