Inspired by Sublime Ads (a SaaS Vincent Ritter is developing), Sublime Blogs is a new project I’m working on. It is a Headless CMS designed specifically to add a blog to any frontend static site generator.

After doing a lot of research, I’m yet to find a cheap and simple solution to move my blog over to Netlify. I’m very particular about my tech stack, and I want to be able to use the tooling I’m familiar with (Jigsaw and Tailwindcss) while still being able to post blog posts easily from my phone.

I decided to solve my problem by building Sublime Blogs. More information coming soon…
