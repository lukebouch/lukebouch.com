I have been making progress on Sublime Blogs. It has been going rather smoothly. It’s always that way whenever I start a new project. Sort of deceitful… it gets much harder down the road. Currently, I’m just setting up everything, defining the database schema, and creating the basic dashboard.

It took me a while to finally decided on a javascript text editor to use on the front-end. I have three major requirements. It has to support markdown, allow image uploading, and be open source, so I can tweak and customize as needed without having to worry about licensing.

[Easy Markdown Editor](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor), or [EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor) for short, fulfilled all three of those requirements and as a bonus, has a great UI. It’s a fork of [SimpleMDE](https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor) with a few added features. After a few hours of work, I was able to get the editor to send its content, on update, back to whatever [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) component it is embedded in. It may not be the most elegant… but it works.
