After reading this post from Mike Crittenden on [experimenting on myself](https://critter.blog/2020/09/21/experimenting-on-myself/), I decided to run my own experiment this past week.

I asked my boss if it would be ok if I started work at 7am instead of my usually 8am and then take an extra hour off for lunch. This gave me an hour and I half off for lunch and it was super nice! Not only did it give me a break from siting at a desk all day but it also gave me a chance to get a few things done.

I'm going to talk to my boss and if he is ok with it, I think I'm going to make this my new schedule.
