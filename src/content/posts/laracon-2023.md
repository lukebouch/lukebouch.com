This year is the first year I'm attending Laracon and I'm very excited!

## Day 0

The day before the conference I flew to Nashville and met up with a few of my co-workers. We are staying a the Dream hotel along with a bunch of other people that are attending the conference.

Jimmy and I went to Baam Burger for dinner. The sweet potato fries were amazing.
