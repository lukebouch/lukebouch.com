It seems like I go through phases of posting frequently, and then it feels like nothing interesting happens for a while and I neglect to write anything.

I have been working on a few projects that some may find interesting. I have outlined them below.

Vue JS
------

I have been working on learning Vue JS. For those of you that are not familiar with Vue, itâ€™s very similar to React (a piece of technology built and used by Facebook (now Meta)<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1">[1](#fn:1)</sup>).

Iâ€™m enjoying using it so far. I have the tendency to jump in head first instead of working through tutorials, so progress on the app Iâ€™m working on is a bit slow. I will post more about it soon.

BMW f650gs
----------

I have been working on replacing the clutch in my 2001 BMW f650gs. Itâ€™s a bit tricky and the stack height on the new one I think is a little too tall. Hopefully it works.

I know there are more projects, but honestly, I started writing out this post several days ago, and now I forgot what I was going to say. Oops ðŸ˜¬

1. Is it proper to nest parentheses inside one another or is that just something I picked up web development? ðŸ¤” [<sup>\[return\]</sup>](#fnref:1)
