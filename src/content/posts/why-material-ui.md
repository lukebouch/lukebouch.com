I don’t understand why Material UI has become so popular. Today at work, I was doing some research on Vue UI Libraries and the majority of the ones I found were implementing it. 

In my opinion it is actually not very pleasing to use but maybe that is just because it so heavily used by all of Google’s app and I so strongly dislike Google after all of the privacy issues that have come out.
