I installed [Pi Hole](https://pi-hole.net) on my Raspberry Pi Zero W and have been playing around with it a little. It is super powerful and you can do some cool stuff with it. I setup a local DNS record for printer.com which maps to the local IP address of our Epson printer.

Annoyingly, the xFi router we lease from xFinity does not allow me to set a custom DNS server for the network. I guess I'm going to have to stick another router in front of it and put it the xFi router in bridge mode. Just like an ISP to lock down their modem/router.
