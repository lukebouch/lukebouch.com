Ever since I was three, my dad has planned an annual camping trip up in the mountains for fathers to take their sons. It changes a little bit every year and the group is always a little different. But my dad, Uncle, cousin and I have been going for 18 years and I've been yet to miss one.

This year, I friend of mine suggested him and I go up one day early. Since today I'm considering a bonus day, I'm calling day 0 since the rest of the group won't be joining us until tomorrow.

Carter and I loaded up after he got off work today. We had already had a sport in mind of where we would be camping but when we got there, there was already someone there. Luckily, I knew of another great spot that would work for the two of us but it's not big enough for the whole group.

Tomorrow, we are going to drive back down to the large spot and ask the guy staying their when he is going to leave. Hopefully, he is just staying tonight and will be gone in the morning. If not, we will either ask him to move considering it's just one guy taking up one of the largest camp site or we will try to make another site work.

I look forward to the rest of the group joining us tomorrow.
