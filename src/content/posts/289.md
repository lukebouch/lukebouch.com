Back in November of 2020, I made the upgrade from an older, custom built, desktop computer running Windows 10 to the new MacBook Pro M1. It was a massive upgrade and I‚Äôm SO glad I made the switch. Apple has done a phenomenal job with their new line-up of processors, but I have been dealing with one major problem that has been driving me crazy for the past year or so.

When my MacBook goes to sleep for a while and I come back, I‚Äôm greeted with the MacOS login screen with all of my open applications closed. I assumed it had crashed and restarted. After dealing with this for the past year or so, I finally decided to contacted Apple Support yesterday.

I just opened up my Mac to the login screen again and all of my open applications had been closed. Very frustrating. I check the `Time since boot`  in System Information and I noticed it said it had been over a day since it booted up. Strange.

I started thinking, maybe it was not restarting but actually just logging me out of my user account. I did some research and figured out that there is an option in MacOS to have it automatically log out after a certain amout of time. And then it hit me, a security assistant app I had install a while ago had suggested that I enable that option. So I did. That is what has been causing my MacBook to seem like it has been crashing when it really hasn‚Äôt.

It was a user error and it‚Äôs fixed now. üòÅ
