Over the past several months, I have been trying to decide whether or not to cancel my Google Workspaces subscription. I use it for my business email and Iâ€™m grandfathered in to an unlimited storage plan for only $12/month.

I used to use it as my main form of storage for all the client work I did but I have since decided I donâ€™t want all my data in the hands of Google, especially not the only copy I have, so I purchased a Synology NAS. Now comes the part where I have to migrate 2TB of data from Google Drive to my NAS. Fun ðŸ˜ž

I wonâ€™t really by using much storage on Google Drive but I donâ€™t like the thought of giving up my grandfathered in plan.

I donâ€™t share as much data with clients anymore (now Iâ€™m doing mostly web developer and that is all on GitHub) so I could just throw any files I need to share on an S3 bucket. Maybe even throw that behind CloudFlare for caching.
