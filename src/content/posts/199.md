I set up CloudFlare to cache a site and in the process broke my internet controlled garage door opener. I don’t recall ever blogging about my custom garage door opener, but I should soon. Basically, I can open and close the garage door with a Siri Shortcut or control it from through a webpage.

I had to restart a server and grey cloud the subdomain I have it setup on. It’s fixed now!
