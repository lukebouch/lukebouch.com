I have been using Ulysses since I started this blog for writing my blog posts before publishing them to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog). I have decide to migrate to using [Bear.app](https://bear.app) instead. I think it is going to work better for me as it will also replace Apple Notes for me as well.

Now I need to to create a Siri Shortcut to be able to automatically post a Bear note to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog).
