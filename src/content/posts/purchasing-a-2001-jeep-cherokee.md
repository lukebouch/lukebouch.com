I have been wanting to sell my truck and purchase a Jeep for a while. The lack of four wheel drive has been driving me crazy every time it snows. Not that I have anywhere I need to be; I just want to get out and drive in the snow. My brother purchased a Cherokee XJ last week and it was the motivation I needed to finally decide to make the switch.

I found a 2000 Jeep Cherokee on Facebook marketplace on Saturday that looked like it was in good condition but was overheating. I thought it was something I could fix myself so my dad, a friend, and I made the hour and a half drive to go look at it.

When I got there, I quickly realized the Jeep needed way more work than I was willing to put into it. There were several issues in addition to the overheating issue.

On the way home, I thought I might as well look to see if there was any other Jeeps listed in the area. I found one that was listed back at home, but after contacting the guy, I learned that it was at his girlfriend's house, which was on the way home. We went to look at it, knowing that it was overpriced.

When we got there, the starter had gone bad on it and so I was not able to hear it run. After looking at it carefully, my dad and I were able to negotiate them down from $5,500 to $3,500! I tried not to show my excitement and eagerly paid her. That night, at 9pm, I started working on replacing the battery and starter. I got it fixed in just over an hour.

Over the past few days, I have been doing some light off roading and having a blast! Here are a few photos.
