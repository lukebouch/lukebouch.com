This is something my parents have been telling me for years but until now, I did not agree with them. After [reducing the notifications I get on my phone](/posts/reducing-notifications) and what I relief it has been, Iâ€™m considering turning off notifications for all texts and instant messages.

My logic for it is, if someone needs my immediate attention. Yes they will loose some convenience of just being able to type out a quick message and send it and instead have to call and wait for me to answer but I think it should take some effort to interrupt me. If they are unwilling to call me, the situation it really not urgent and they can wait until I activate choose to pull out my phone and check my texts.
