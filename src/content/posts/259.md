I setup a [Paddle.com](https://paddle.com) account for [Sublime Blogs](https://sublimeblogs.com), but they rejected me. They said my product was deemed high risk. Maybe it was because I did not have my website done yet? Anywaysâ€¦ its on to Stripe now; which was actually much easier to setup. You lost my business Paddle.
