Over the past few weeks, I have been working on slowly impementing [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) for my blog. Iâ€™m considering adding comment support to Sublime Blogs. This would allow you to not only have a form on your front-end that sends a POST request to the SublimeBlogs API, but it would also support WebMentions.
