I finished migrating my site from Jigsaw to Laravel. It took me a little while but I’m glad I did. Jigsaw is great for simple sites, especially if you don’t want to worry about managing a server to run that site, but the development experience is not that great. 

I still have a lot I want to do to this site and having a backend will be necessary.
