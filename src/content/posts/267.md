I moved Sublime Blogs from Digital Ocean Spaces to Backblaze B2 for S3 storage. I like DO Spaces but it is severely lacking in a lot a features; namely, file versioning. B2 is also significantly cheaper when it comes to storage, but they make up for it in egress bandwidth cost. I donâ€™t think a lot of people know this but they offer free egress to Cloudflare. So in the end, it is much cheaper than DO Spaces and offers more features.
