I migrated all the wallpaper from [thewallpaperstand.com](https://thewallpaperstand.com) to [lukebouch.com/wallpapers](https://lukebouch.com/wallpapers). I think it makes more sense to have all of my side projects under my personal domain instead of having to pay for a bunch of different domains. I will of course keep my large projects like [Sublime Blogs](https://sublimeblogs.com) separate and on their own domain names.
