Today was a pretty uneventful day. since we got to bed so late last night, Carter and I slept in until about 10am this morning. We cooked eggs for breakfast and then hopped in the car.

On the way in yesterday, we had seen a sign saying that one of the roads we drove on was going to be closed starting today and drove to see if we were going to need to find an alternative route for the rest of the group. Luckily, it was closed farther down the road and it was not going to affect us.

On the way down the mountain, we also check to see when the guy in the camp site we wanted was going to leave. Unfortunately, he said he was going to be there a few more days. He was super nice and offered to move to a smaller spot and let our large group take the big one but we did not want to bother him so we made another spot work.

The rest of the group made good time and showed up around 3pm. One of the guys showed up with less than half of the firewood he started out with left on the back of his truck. It was actually pretty funny.

For dessert, we had dump cake and homemade ice cream which was amazing!

Nothing super exciting happened today but it was still a great day. I'm getting up at 5am tomorrow morning to see the sunrise from the top of the mountain. As it is already 12am, I better get to sleep.
