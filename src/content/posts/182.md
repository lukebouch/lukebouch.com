I upgraded TPP from Laravel 8 to Laravel 9! It took about an hour to go through and update all of my dependencies, update the PHP version on the server, and change the GitHub CI/CD action to run PHP 8.1.

This was my first time every upgrading Laravel. It was not too hard. Great job Taylor and the Laravel team!
