Note to self:

When I run into the issue where Vite HRM is not working in Laravel and 404 responses for requests to `__vite_ping` start showing up in the browser, read this [issue](https://github.com/laravel/vite-plugin/issues/27).

Add
```
server: {
      https: true,
      hmr: {
        host: 'localhost',
      }
    }
```
to your Vite config.

You have no idea how many times I keep running into this and forgetting how to fix it.
